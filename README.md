# Ex2_Logistic_regression_prediction_models

This programming exercise was done as part of Coursera's Machine Learning Course (Stanford University), taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.

## Predict admission decision for students based on  exam scores
* Built a classification model that estimates an applicant's chances of admission into a university based on exam results using logistic regression
* Historical data from previous applicants was used as the training set
* Used Octave's fminunc optimization solver to find optimal parameters of the model
* Computed training accuracy of the classifier


## Predict quality assurance result (passed/not) with test results for microchips from a fabrication plant 
* Implemented regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant pass QA based on test results
* Used a dataset of test results on past microchips to build the model
* Performed feature mapping to obtain a more expressive classifier and implemented regularization  to combat overfitting
* Used Octave's fminunc solver to learn the optimal parameters
* Studied the effect of the regularization parameter on the fit
